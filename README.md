# N-body Simulation

The code for an N-body simulation in Python. This is the project for the Computetional Models for Complex System exam.

# Project structure

Both Jupyter notebook and Python script file (.py) are provided to facilitate different preferences.
The script files are:

* simulation.py: this script contains the main simulation algorithm. 
* simulation_methods.py: this script contains the implementation of three methods for solving ODEs: Euler, Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashford.
* simulation_utils.py: this script contains different utility functions used in the simulation, like the code for computing the gravitational force between the bodies, create a .gif file that shows the motion of each body, and so on.
* Body.py: this is the class definition of a Body.
* main.py: this is the file you call for running the simulation.

# Required libraries

* numpy
* matplotlib
* mpl_toolkits
* gc

# Installation
'''bash
git clone https://github.com/giorgio-angelo-esposito/N-body-simulation.git cd N-body-simulation
